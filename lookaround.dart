// Log of things I've seen looking around

// <1>
//
// I see a lot of rocks, a lot of sky, a lot of
// pine trees, and a perfectly fashioned stick.
//
// Possible exits:
// West

// <Go West>
//
// There is a steep cliff that is very icy, but
// the conditions appear to be good for ice
// screws and an ice axe. If we had these items
// and a climbing rope, we could fashion a 
// swedish harness and begin rapelling down
// the side of the mountain.
//
// Possible exits: 
// Back east (there's nothing there bros)
// Down a short path to the north
// Behind a tree with something odd poking out

// <Look Behind Tree>
// 
// Upon approaching the tree you see that it is
// a grand White Pine of approximately 50cm in
// diameter at eye level. You remember from
// an emergency rapelling course that this is
// suitable to carry 500 lbs (life and safety)
// with an appropriate rope.
//
// Around the bottom of the tree is a set of 
// webbing rated for 750 lbs and some carabiners
// that would facilitate the attachment and
// retreival of some rope.
//
// Next to the tree you find an ice axe head,
// and some ice screws. Presumably left behind
// by a group who broke a handle and had some
// extra hardware to go with it.
// 
// Possible exits:
// Back where I came from

// <Roll Dice>
// I don't have any fucking dice

// <Take Ice Head + Ice Screws, make Ice Axe>

// <Take Hardware on Tree>
// You cannot take the carabiners because
// they are permanently affixed to the base
// of the tree

// <God Blesses me>
// I find the will to walk back to the edge of
// the cliff. I will not jump, it's too far.
// Luckily I have the majority of the hardware
// I need to descend. However, I am
// missing a climbing rope.
//
// There is an exit down a short path to the
// north
